## PokeSniper - Snipe Those Bitches!

Upon installing the app, always try to move it to system applications in order to give it priority. This will make the app work better and crash less.

Always remove the previous version completely and reboot before installing the update.


## Q&A

**Always failed to catch pokemon! Why?**

You are softbanned. Don't jump continents, or wait 10 minutes - 6 hours logged out before you do. The app has been set to avoid softbanning, but there's still a chance that soft ban will happen because using third party API.

**Why does the app crash on startup?**

Intel based android phones are supported, but still worked on.    
Find out your phone API and Google your model if you are not sure before posting for help.

**App crashes when I press "Snipe Those Bitches!" button**

Make sure you have set all required settings, and type valid input.

**I am receiving errors, force closes, etc:**

Try these standard troubleshooting steps:

- Access settings, Apps, and select PokeSniper.
- Force Stop
- Clear Cache
- Clear Data
- Toggle Airplane mode
- Reboot Phone
- Remove / Reinstall latest version
 

**After a fresh install, tweak as few options as possible to start off.**

1. Access settings.
2. Access login info.
    - Add username, password, and select google account indicator if applicable.
    - For google, the full email address is needed.  Passwords are also CaSe sensitive. This means your username is YourMail@gmail.com and your password is yOuRpaSsSword12345	
3. Set your home coordinates
	- This is the "magic" to avoid softbanned. You must set this settings.


*It is recommended to pretend you are flying on an airplane.  Jump to different locations by logging off and back on to the app based upon how long a typical commercial flight would take.*

*Changing your Device_ID to avoid permaban*
If Niantic decides to issue permanent bans. They will be either by IP or Device_ID. Currently most of the botting apps make the users have the same Device_ID. It would be wise to change it prior to use.
To change device ID on a rooted, Xposed Framework phone, use [this app](http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.phoneinfo.changer)
For other situations look into [this guide](http://alltrickszone.com/how-to-change-android-id-rooted-non-phone-easy-guide/)

 
### In Game Troubleshooting:

Make sure you can log out and back into standard PokemonGo App without any issues.

Make sure there is room for Pokemon and items.  After so much looting, everything gets full and you will need to clear it out.  Regarding Pokemon, use the app's 'Pokemon setting' to remove specific Pokemon and avoid manual effort.

You can always disable 'Location' on your phone, and log into the PoGO app to clear out your inventory and do manual micromanagement. Disabling 'Location' will make the red bar 'GPS not found' show up but you can still use the app. 
Always check this before asking here - usually your bag or pokeslots are full, or you have no balls. (Pun intended)
